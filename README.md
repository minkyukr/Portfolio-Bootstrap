# Portfolio-Bootstrap
Creating a portfolio page using bootstrap only and minimizing the use of media query.
A lot of things can be accomplished through bootstrap, powerful resource.
With imagination and little tweaks here and there great things can be accomplished.
However I find it hard to manipulate some the things with bootstrap.
I am still not sure how to delete the margins(?) the gap between two colors between two colors footer.
