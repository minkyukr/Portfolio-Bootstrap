# Portfolio-Bootstrap
Creating a portfolio page using bootstrap only and minimizing the use of media query.
A lot of things can be accomplished through bootstrap, it is powerful resource.
With imagination and little tweaks here and there I tried to create a portfolio, not same as portfolio but different because is more fun.
However I find it hard to manipulate some things with bootstrap.
As you can see, my css file is empty and that's because I wanted to get close to the homeworks example without utilizing any media queries.
